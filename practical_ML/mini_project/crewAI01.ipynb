      "Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence , such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ]\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ]\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      " Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, while raising ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",
      "Goals\n",
      "The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ]\n",
      "Reasoning and problem-solving\n",
      "Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ]\n",
      "Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. [ 16 ] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\n",
      "Knowledge representation\n",
      "An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\n",
      "Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ]\n",
      "A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\n",
      " Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ]\n",
      "Planning and decision-making\n",
      "An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ]\n",
      "In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ]\n",
      "In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\n",
      " A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ]\n",
      "Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ]\n",
      "Learning\n",
      "Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ]\n",
      "In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\n",
      "There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ]\n",
      "In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ]\n",
      "Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ]\n",
      "Natural language processing\n",
      "Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ]\n",
      "Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\n",
      " Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ]\n",
      "Perception\n",
      "Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ]\n",
      "The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ]\n",
      "Social intelligence\n",
      "Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ]\n",
      "Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction .\n",
      " However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ]\n",
      "General intelligence\n",
      "A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence . [ 68 ]\n",
      "Techniques\n",
      "AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. [ b ]\n",
      "Search and optimization\n",
      "AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search .\n",
      "State space search\n",
      "State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ]\n",
      "Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ]\n",
      "Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ]\n",
      "Local search\n",
      "Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ]\n",
      "Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm.\n",
      " Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ]\n",
      "Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ]\n",
      "Logic\n",
      "Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . [ 79 ] \n",
      "Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") [ 80 ] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \" Every X is a Y \" and \"There are some X s that are Y s\"). [ 81 ]\n",
      "Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules .\n",
      " Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ]\n",
      "Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ]\n",
      "Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ]\n",
      "Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\n",
      "Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\n",
      "A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables\n",
      "Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ]\n",
      "Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ]\n",
      "Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ]\n",
      "Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\n",
      "Classifiers and statistical learning methods\n",
      "The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers [ 99 ] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ]\n",
      "There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] \n",
      "The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ]\n",
      "Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ]\n",
      "Artificial neural networks\n",
      "A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain .\n",
      "An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ]\n",
      "Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ]\n",
      "In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful architecture for recurrent neural networks. [ 109 ] Perceptrons [ 110 ] use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning [ 111 ] uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing , where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object. [ 112 ]\n",
      "Deep learning\n",
      "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ]\n",
      "Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 111 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ]\n",
      "Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ]\n",
      "GPT\n",
      "Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]\n",
      "Current models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT , Grok , Claude , Copilot , and LLaMA . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text. [ 128 ]\n",

      "Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence\n",
      "In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. [ 129 ] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, [ 130 ] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant. [ 131 ]\n",
      "The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law , named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore , who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, [ 132 ] a trend sometimes called Huang's law , [ 133 ] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang .\n",

[ 134 ] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath , medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]\n",
      "For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 141 ] [ 142 ]\n",

      "Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. [ 143 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997. [ 144 ] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 145 ] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go -playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie , who was the best Go player in the world. [ 146 ] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker -playing program Pluribus . [ 147 ] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero , which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [ 148 ] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II , a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. [ 149 ] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. [ 150 ] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. [ 151 ]\n",
      "Mathematics\n",
      "Large language models, such as GPT-4 , Gemini , Claude , Llama or Mistral , are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations . They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning [ 152 ] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. [ 153 ] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [ 154 ] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. [ 155 ] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math , that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems. [ 156 ] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.

AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\n",

If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act .

      "COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist . In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 254 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 256 ]\n",
      "A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 257 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 258 ]\n",
      "Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.

One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them.

There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. [ 264 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 265 ]\n",

      "In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 283 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed .

      " First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 294 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 295 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".

      "Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 297 ]\n",

Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 321 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed.

[ 329 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 330 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 331 ] [ 332 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 333 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 333 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 333 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 334 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 335 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics.

      "The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 347 ] [ 348 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 350 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 351 ] [ 348 ]\n",
      "The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 348 ]\n",
      "Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 355 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 356 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 357 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. [ w ] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill [ 359 ] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects . [ 360 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 361 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ]\n",
      "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 362 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ]\n",
      "Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 363 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 364 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 369 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 370 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 371 ]\n",
      "AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \" narrow \" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics , economics and mathematics ). [ 372 ] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect ). [ 373 ] \n",
      "However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ]\n",
      "Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. [ 11 ] \n",
      "For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. [ y ] \n",
      "Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 375 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 376 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 377 ] (including curated datasets, [ 376 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 333 ]\n",
      "The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022.\n",
      "In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 310 ]\n",
      "In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 378 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 379 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 380 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 381 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 382 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 383 ]\n",

      "Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\n",
      "Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 384 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.

[ 385 ]\n",
      "Defining artificial intelligence\n",
      "See also: Turing test , Intelligent agent , Dartmouth workshop , and Synthetic intelligence\n",
      "Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 387 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 387 ] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 351 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 388 ]\n",
      "The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 389 ]\n",
      "Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 390 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 391 ]\n",
      "McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 392 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 393 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\n",
      " Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 394 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\n",
      " Some authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI, [ 395 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 396 ]\n",
      "Evaluating approaches to AI\n",
      "No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\n",
      "Symbolic AI and its limits\n",
      "Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 398 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 399 ]\n",
      "However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 400 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 401 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ]\n",
      "The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 403 ] [ 404 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\n",

Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 405 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\n",

Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\n",

      "Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence\n",
      "AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 406 ] [ 407 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\n",
      "Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind\n",
      "Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness\n",
      "There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" [ 408 ] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction .\n",
      "Consciousness\n",
      "Main articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind\n",
      "David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. [ 409 ] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like .

      "Computationalism and functionalism\n",
      "Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\n",
      "Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 411 ]\n",
      "Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 415 ]\n",
      "AI welfare and rights\n",
      "It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 416 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 417 ] [ 418 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 417 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 419 ]\n",
      "In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 420 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 421 ] [ 422 ]\n",
      "Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.

      "Future\n",
      "Superintelligence and the singularity\n",
      "A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 407 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 423 ]\n",

      "A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 429 ]\n",
      "Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 430 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 431 ]\n",
      "Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. , the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina , as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? , by Philip K. Dick . Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence. [ 432 ]\n",

Retrieved 8 December 2023 . Instead, the United States has developed a new area of dominance that the rest of the world views with a mixture of awe, envy, and resentment: artificial intelligence... From AI models and research to cloud computing and venture capital, U.S. companies, universities, and research labs – and their affiliates in allied countries – appear to have an enormous lead in both developing cutting-edge AI and commercializing it. The value of U.S. venture capital investments in AI start-ups exceeds that of the rest of the world combined.\n",

'We can't count on governments driven by campaign finance contributions [from tech companies] to push back.'... Marcus details the demands that citizens should make of their governments and the tech companies . They include transparency on how AI systems work; compensation for individuals if their data [are] used to train LLMs ( large language model )s and the right to consent to this use; and the ability to hold tech companies liable for the harms they cause by eliminating Section 230 , imposing cash penalties, and passing stricter product liability laws... Marcus also suggests... that a new, AI-specific federal agency, akin to the FDA , the FCC , or the FTC , might provide the most robust oversight....

      "Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet .

      "GPT\n",
      "Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]\n",

      "In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ]\n",
